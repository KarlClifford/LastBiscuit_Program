# Last biscuit program

The Last Biscuit program is a simple variation of the game Nim.

Players take it in turns to chose one of two barrels and subtract a number of biscuits from that barrel. The player can also choose to subtract the same number of biscuits from both barrels or skip the round if they have not done so already. The player that takes the last biscuit wins.
